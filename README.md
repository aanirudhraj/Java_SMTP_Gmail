# Java_SMTP_Gmail
In this example, we are going to learn how to send email by SMTP server installed on the machine e.g. Postcast server, Apache James server, Cmail server etc. If you want to send email by using your SMTP server provided by the host provider, see the example after this one.
For sending the email using JavaMail API, you need to load the two jar files:

    mail.jar
    activation.jar
